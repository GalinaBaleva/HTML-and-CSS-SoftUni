            <h1>Three laws of robotics</h1>
            <p>Rules developed by science-fiction writer Isaac Asimov, who sought to create an ethical system for humans
                and robots.</p>

                <p>A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with

                </header>
                <p>A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or
                    Second Law</p>

            <p>Asimov later added another rule, known as the fourth or zeroth law, that superseded the others. It stated
                that “a robot may not harm humanity, or, by inaction, allow humanity to come to harm.”</p>
